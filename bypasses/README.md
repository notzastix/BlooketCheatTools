# prompt()
### A bypass to use Prompt(), becuase Ben (the owner of blooket) disabled Prompt(), Alert() and Confirm() on the blooket website.
#### How to use: just use it like normal prompt()
#### example:
```javascript
prompt("the question", true) //returns a number.
prompt("the question") //returns a string
```
#### note: currently their isnt a way to paste javascript, like the normal prompt() does, so you have to change console.log(data/dataa) to a variable, running a diffrent function etc.
